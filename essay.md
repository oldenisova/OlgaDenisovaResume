<h1>Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?</h1>
<p1>I loved problem solving and mathematics since my childhood. My favourite toys were dolls and puzzles, such as Rubik Cube.
After high school, I decided to study Applied Math at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, which I entered by wining a competitive Olympiad in Physics and Math that provided full scholarship.
After graduation, it didn't took much effort to find a good job as Business Analyst in Moscow, which exposed me to software development world.
I didn't do any programming at my previous positions and had been involved mostly in requirements gathering, I still closely interacted with development teams. Being constantly curious and trying to learn new things,
I was trying to get more involved in the development process and liked it, but didn't have a chance to do programming first-hand.</p1>
<p2>When I came to the US, I realized that the number of opportunities that match the skills I obtained in Moscow is quite limited.
At the same time, there are significantly more software development positions that remain unfilled for long time.
I decided to shift my career towards being among those who actually create and develop, i.e. become a programmer.
I started to watch various tutorials online and implementing simple algorithms.
Even though I enjoy it, this type of learning is lacking coherency, organization and credentials.
Since formal education is very expensive in the US, I started to loose hope about fulfilling my goal.
Then I discovered Ada and decided to apply.</p2>
